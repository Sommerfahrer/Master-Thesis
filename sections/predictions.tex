    After training or loading an already trained network the toolchain starts with the prediction of all images with the ending \flqq jpg\frqq on the user given folder.
    All results are stored in the results directory in the project folder, but only prediction above the threshold will be saved.
    For reading and working the results with a programming language there will be also a \flqq submission.csv\frqq created, with the absolute path of the predicted image, the predicted class, the id of the class and the accuracy.
