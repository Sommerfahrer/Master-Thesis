        Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent \& simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear \& actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.
