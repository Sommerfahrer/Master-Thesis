    In 2015 the model \ac{resnet} \autocite{resnet} was the winner of ImageNet challenge \parencite{ILSVRC15}.
    \ac{resnet} was one of the first extremely deep networks with up to 152 in relation to the winner of the ImageNet challenge 2012 AlexNet \autocite{alexnet}, which has only 8 convolutional layers.
    For this project \ac{resnet50} was chosen, because the relationship between accuracy and speed is given.
    To avoid starting from scratch a pre-trained \ac{resnet50} with \href{http://www.image-net.org}{ImageNet} weights was used and do transfer learning and fine tuning the model with the user given classes.
