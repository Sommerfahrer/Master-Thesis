        TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms and an implementation for executing such algorithms.
        A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards.
