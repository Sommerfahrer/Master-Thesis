    Transfer learning is a method where a pre-trained network is reused for another task.
    Therefore you need to import the pre-trained network, freeze all layers and replace the output layer, which is only trainable now. 
    So most of the trainable weights are non-trainable except the weights of the output layer, for example in this project the model has only 4,098 of 23,591,810 trainable parameters.
    Now we can start with the training for maximum 100 epochs, but early stopper was implemented to avoid unnecessary training time.
    There is also a model checker, which only save the solution of each epoch if the validation loss is smaller than the saved model.
