    Finally a toolchain was created, which will automatically train with images from search engines as training and validation dataset.
    After training a prediction for the selected classes can be made with a reasonably accurate localization.
    The positive result of the classification was surprising, even if the localization cannot keep up with the performance of the classification.
    For pre-labelling or as a \glqq better\grqq\ dataset, this approach could mean an improvement, at least on very common classes.
    For the future could still be found out how a network trained with the data set generated in this project compares to the \glqq original\grqq\ network trained with search engines.
    It could also be a benefit for labelling for a new labelling company, which is not yet able to use its own labeled images to train a network for pre-labelling.
